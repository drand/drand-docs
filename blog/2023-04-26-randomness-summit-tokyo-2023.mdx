### Overview

The Randomness Summit was a one day conference consisting of talks from a range of speakers on topics such as verifiable randomness functions, verifiable delay functions, distributed key generation, cryptographic specifications, and more!

### Kickoff Presentation

- **Speaker:** Patrick McClurg from [Randamu](https://randa.mu/)
- **Topic:** Brief overview of drand's progress since the 2020 Randomness Summit.

### üìΩÔ∏è Presentations

1. **Generating Distributed Randomness**
    - **Speaker:** Lefteris Kokoris Kogias from IST Austria and Mysten Labs
    - **Topic:** Architecting for producing distributed randomness under asynchrony safely.
2. **Specification-Writing Tips**
    - **Speaker:** Filippo Valsorda
    - **Topic:** Recommendations for specification-writers on avoiding common pitfalls when specifying protocols and schemes using randomness.
3. **Types of Randomness Beacons**
    - **Speaker:** Bernardo David from the University of Copenhagen
    - **Topic:** Comprehensive breakdown of different types of randomness beacons, their guarantees, and how to combine them to fit your security model.
4. **Supra VRF Architecture**
    - **Speaker:** Pratyay Mukherjee
    - **Topic:** Challenges faced in designing the [**Supra**](https://supraoracles.com/) VRF and the innovative solutions created.
5. **NIST Randomness Efforts**
    - **Speaker:** Luis Brand√£o from NIST
    - **Topic:** Ongoing efforts to standardize randomness beacons and threshold cryptography. Details can be found [**on the NIST website**](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons).
6. **Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithms**
    - **Speaker:** Matej Pavlovic from the Consensus Lab team at [Protocol Labs][PROTOCOL]
    - **Topic:** Latest research into scalable Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms and how randomness can improve their performance characteristics.
7. **Timelock Encryption**
    - **Speaker:** Yolan Romailler from [Randamu](https://randa.mu/)
    - **Topic:** Shortened version of his talk on timelock encryption from the main Real World Crypto conference. The full talk is available on the [**IACR YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh849Ij3lhU).

### üåé Real-World Applications

1. **Drand Implementation in Rust and No-Code Tool**
    - **Speaker:** Hong Yu from [StorSwift](/blog/storswift-joins-the-league-of-entropy)
    - **Topic:** Upcoming drand implementation in Rust and a no-code tool for creating smart contracts using timelock encryption.
2. **CLI Tool for Drand and Timelock Encryption**
    - **Speaker:** Thibault Meunier from [Cloudflare](https://drand.love/12bbcd90be5f4e42af18599f65019e7e)
    - **Topic:** New [**CLI tool**](https://github.com/thibmeu/drand-rs) for drand and timelock encryption.
