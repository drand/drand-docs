<p>On February 21, 2024, we had to abort our v2.0.2-testnet ceremony after encountering a series of bugs. The <code>default</code>, <code>testnet-g</code>, and <code>testnet-unchained-3s</code> networks were down for about 45 minutes, while <code>quicknet-t</code> remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>While it felt like a disaster, this is precisely why we have a testnet. It&#x27;s better to face issues here than risk the 100% uptime of the mainnet!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prior-to-the-ceremony"><strong>Prior to the Ceremony</strong><a href="#prior-to-the-ceremony" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to prior-to-the-ceremony" title="Direct link to prior-to-the-ceremony">​</a></h3>
<p>We&#x27;ll focus on the <code>default</code> network for the remainder of this post-mortem, though the issues generally applied to the other networks as well. The prior <code>default</code> ceremony was in May 2023, nearly a year before this incident. In that ceremony, 12 nodes participated, with a threshold of 7. Due to known, non-deterministic issues in the codebase, 2 nodes failed to complete the distributed key generation. This left the network with 10 operational nodes.</p>
<p>In a previous testnet upgrade (for <code>quicknet-t</code> on January 10, 2024), the network upgraded to v2.0.0-testnet. Due to API incompatibilities, nodes on this version couldn&#x27;t connect to nodes older than v1.5.7. cLabs did not participate in this ceremony and failed to upgrade their node since, causing a fork from the rest of the network, leaving the default network with 9 operational nodes.</p>
<p>In preparation for the same ceremony, a new member of Ken Labs accidentally overwrote their <code>default</code> keypair with an erroneous command. We&#x27;ve since published a fix to prevent this. Coupled with reverse proxy issues, the Ken Labs node became inoperative, reducing the <code>default</code> network to 8 operational nodes—just 1 above the threshold and at risk of halting.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-update-before-the-ceremony"><strong>The Update Before the Ceremony</strong><a href="#the-update-before-the-ceremony" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-update-before-the-ceremony" title="Direct link to the-update-before-the-ceremony">​</a></h3>
<p>Protocol Labs updated their nodes to v2.0.2-testnet first, and initially, everything looked fine.</p>
<p>IPFS Force soon reported issues starting their node due to a missing <code>SchemeName</code> when loading their key pair. They hadn&#x27;t upgraded their node sequentially to v2.0.2-testnet, so their keys didn&#x27;t contain all the correct fields. We quickly published v2.0.3-testnet, which included a simple patch, allowing IPFS Force to upgrade and start their node successfully.</p>
<p>As others started upgrading, we saw an uptick in <code>http2: frame too large</code> messages when connecting to some nodes, reported by Automata Network. Knowing Automata Network uses an nginx reverse proxy, we assumed it was related to misconfigured nginx gRPC proxies. We debugged with Automata Network, restarted the nodes, and the error disappeared temporarily.</p>
<p>As more nodes updated, they reported similar errors, and restarts no longer resolved the issues. Additionally, the <code>http2: frame too large</code> error inconsistently affected different nodes. Automata and QRL also reported <code>error reading server preface: EOF</code> when connecting to PL nodes.</p>
<p>The network stopped aggregating beacons as usual due to these connectivity issues. Periodic aggregations occurred, but not fast enough to catch up.</p>
<p>While debugging and assisting DIA data, we found their node had joined <code>quicknet-t</code> with the <code>TLS</code> field set to false. In v2.0.2-testnet, we removed TLS termination from the drand binary, expecting members to handle TLS via a reverse proxy. Our nodes connected to DIA over plaintext, which was unexpected but not a security issue (everything in drand is signed and verified).</p>
<p>This fallback to non-TLS connections explained the errors we saw. QRL logs confirmed their node dropped to non-TLS connections, causing the <code>http2: frame too large</code> and <code>error reading server preface: EOF</code> errors. We quickly shipped patch v2.0.4-testnet, and as nodes updated, the network began to recover.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-ceremony"><strong>The Ceremony</strong><a href="#the-ceremony" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-ceremony" title="Direct link to the-ceremony">​</a></h3>
<p>After allowing the network to catch up, we proceeded with the leader&#x27;s ceremony instructions but encountered an error.</p>
<p>During the first load of a daemon on v2.x after a v1.5.x ceremony, the group file migrates into the DKG database. This worked as expected, but a change in our signature scheme required fetching new signatures for participating nodes. An oversight caused even the keys for nodes leaving the network to attempt to fetch, leading to failures in generating a valid proposal.</p>
<p>To avoid further updates, we deployed a patched version to our leader node and generated a proposal successfully.</p>
<p>With the patched version, we initiated the resharing on the leader node but encountered an invalid packet signature error. Another node received our packet, attempted to gossip it, and the signature was deemed invalid. Despite our DKG database reporting a successful proposal, we were unsure of other nodes&#x27; states.</p>
<p>Facing time pressure, we decided to abort the DKG and retry. The leader can issue aborts unilaterally, and this packet gossiped without issue.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we should have asked other LoE members for their <code>drand dkg status</code> output to confirm receipt of the proposal. If all had received it, we could have continued the resharing.</p>
<p>After aborting, we attempted to restart the ceremony but faced another bug. Nodes keep copies of the last successful DKG state and the most recent interim state. Comparing the new proposal against the interim state, rather than the complete state, caused rejection by the leader node and other nodes.</p>
<p>We instructed LoE members to stop their nodes, run <code>drand dkg nuke --id default</code>, and restart their nodes, restoring the v1.5.x DKG state and refreshing the interim state. With some members unable to commit more time, we called off the ceremony.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong><a href="#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to next-steps" title="Direct link to next-steps">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Testnet LoE members who haven&#x27;t run <code>drand dkg nuke --id default</code> should do so at their earliest convenience.</li>
<li>The drand team will patch all identified issues and release a new version.</li>
<li>The drand team will add additional testing for erroneous flows and DKG timeouts.</li>
<li>We will instruct LoE members to upgrade more gradually ahead of any ceremony to identify issues sooner.</li>
<li>We will perform an asynchronous testnet ceremony in the coming weeks.</li>
<li>We will run a mainnet ceremony on v1.5.9 to ensure all required upgrade paths are met.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><a href="#final-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to final-thoughts" title="Direct link to final-thoughts">​</a></h3>
<p>This was not a good look for the drand team. Drand v2 has been in the pipeline for over a year, and this is the second aborted ceremony in a row. We owe an apology to the League of Entropy members for wasting their time. This shouldn’t happen.</p>
<p>After numerous ceremonies last year, everyone is experiencing ceremony fatigue. Mandating early or late participation is unsustainable. v2 promises fully asynchronous ceremonies, eliminating the need for everyone to be online at once. The leader can start the ceremony, and members can join anytime over a week.</p>
<p>Outages, especially in distributed systems, often result from multiple bugs in succession. This outage was no exception. In v2, many things changed, leading to a confluence of edge cases. We should have done many small releases instead of one large one.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who participated. We are continually impressed by the professionalism and engagement of League of Entropy members. Without you, we wouldn’t be running the flagship threshold network serving over a billion requests per month.</p>

This significant upgrade harnesses the capabilities of the new unchained randomness mode, enables timelock encryption in production, and delivers outputs at a much faster frequency of <strong>3 seconds</strong>!</p>
<p>The network has now been running without issues for a month and a half since its launch on August 23rd, and we’ve seen our first early adopters start transitioning to it successfully.</p>

<p>Keep reading to learn more details about the new features this network launch enables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unchained randomness mode:</strong> This allows for <strong>faster and simpler beacon verification</strong>. Furthermore, unchained mode allows one to predict the message that will be signed in a future round (but nothing else), thus enabling “<strong>timelock encryption</strong>”!</li>
<li><strong>Runs on the League of Entropy’s mainnet nodes:</strong> Offers robustness, scalability, and reliability to our users. It runs on the same nodes that have been flawlessly delivering beacons every 30 seconds for the past 3 years without missing a beat.</li>
<li><strong>3-second frequency:</strong> Quicker generation compared to the legacy frequency, enabling faster applications, better UX, and higher throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Shorter beacons:</strong> Thanks to the G1-G2 swap that we’re detailing below, we’ve been able to cut our signatures’ size by 50%!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#x27;ve been following our blog, you&#x27;ll remember our previous post about <a href="/blog/tags/Timelock Encryption is now supported on drand main 327425b1e16d4c22aa0d785dbf1c5fbb.md">Timelock Encryption is now supported on drand mainnet</a> where we announced the launch of our new <code>fastnet</code> network that supported our timelock scheme. The League of Entropy launched this new drand network on March 1st, 2023. However, we quickly identified an issue with our BLS signatures on G1 that made them non-compliant with the Hash To Curve <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9380.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC 9380</a> specification, as well as most BLS signatures implementations on G1 apart from ours. Therefore, we had to double down and launch the <code>quicknet</code> network to fix this issue.</p>
<p>We’ll be sun-setting <code>fastnet</code> in the coming months <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/07/03/fastnet-sunset-quicknet-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as announced previously</a>. We are currently going to scale down <code>fastnet</code> by another 3 nodes in November, and we’ll be shutting it down completely at the earliest opportunity. Please reach out to</p>
<p>us if this is a concern for you or your team.</p>

<p>For developers and users eager to dive into the new <code>quicknet</code> drand network, our <a href="https://drand.love/developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official documentation</a> provides detailed resources about using drand relays and beacons.</p>
<p>We also have a blog post about “<a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/06/02/drand-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drand for beginners</a>” that’s packed with useful information and another one about <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/03/16/draffle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using drand on-chain</a> with a demo lottery use-case running on the Filecoin Virtual Machine.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="g1---g2-swap"><strong>G1 - G2 Swap</strong><a href="#g1---g2-swap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to g1---g2-swap" title="Direct link to g1---g2-swap">​</a></h2>
<p>Let us see what the G1-G2 swap really means!</p>
<p>The BLS signature schemes operate on “pairing-friendly” elliptic curves. These curves typically define 3 groups that are of interest to the cryptographer: the group G1 and G2 and the so-called “target group” GT onto which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing-based_cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pairing operation</a> will allow projecting points from the groups G1 and G2 in a bilinear manner.</p>
<p>In the current instantiations of drand networks, we’re relying on the pairing-friendly curve BLS12-381, whose groups G1 and G2 have points that can be encoded in 48 bytes and 96 bytes, respectively.</p>
<p>Therefore, it usually makes sense for BLS signatures to be instantiated with the <strong>public key</strong> over G1 and the <strong>signatures</strong> over G2, meaning <em>shorter</em> public keys but <em>longer</em> signatures. This is so because the BLS signature scheme allows for <strong>signature aggregation</strong>, which means we can aggregate multiple signatures for different public keys into a single aggregated signature that verifies against the many public keys. Using short public keys but long signatures minimizes the overall size of the data required for verification.</p>
<p>However, this does not apply to drand’s beacons since new ones are generated at a fixed frequency, each with its own signature. Therefore, it makes more sense for drand’s beacons to have shorter signatures and a longer group public key, since we cannot benefit from the aggregation capabilities of BLS signatures and the public key for a given group never changes, and can thus be stored only once, unlike the signatures which need to be stored for each single beacon.</p>
<p>This is the reason why it makes more sense given the way drand beacons work to have the public key of the group on G2 (i.e. be of size 96 bytes) and have the signatures of the beacons on the group G1 of BLS12-381 (i.e. be encoded into only 48 bytes).</p>
<p>This swap allowed us to <strong>reduce the size of the drand beacons emitted by the new <code>quicknet</code> network by 50%</strong>, as well as to <strong>increase the performance and reduce the gas cost</strong> of any on-chain operations pertaining to drand beacons produced by <code>quicknet</code>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unchained-mode"><strong>Unchained Mode</strong><a href="#unchained-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to unchained-mode" title="Direct link to unchained-mode">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve introduced the notion of <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/#unchained-randomness-timed-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unchained beacons</a> last year on the blog already. But in essence, the new drand network brings a host of improvements aimed at enhancing the overall UX for drand users and developers. The &#x27;unchained mode&#x27; means that new random beacons are entirely independent from previous ones, meaning that you can now perform stateless verification of a beacon, without having to keep a record of past beacons!</p>
<p>These enhancements are designed to make the drand network more robust, efficient, and user-friendly. They help in reducing the computational and storage load of our users, making drand more cost-effective and faster. The unchained nature of the beacons also means you can now decide to sample only one every 5 beacons to have a frequency of 15s or one every 20 beacons to have a frequency of 1 minute! This significantly improves flexibility and scalability for everyone.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to your projects and ideas, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Slack workspace</a> to discuss these.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="security-considerations"><strong>Security Considerations</strong><a href="#security-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to security-considerations" title="Direct link to security-considerations">​</a></h2>
<p>Finally, you might be wondering what these changes might mean from a <strong>security</strong> point of view. On that front, the guarantees of the League of Entropy (LoE) network remain the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>A random beacon <strong>cannot be predicted</strong> unless a threshold number of LoE nodes collude (current threshold is 12 out of 22 nodes; it should increase as the League of Entropy onboards new members).</li>
<li>A random beacon <strong>cannot be biased</strong> by anybody unless the attacker is able to change the public key of the group, which should be hard-coded in your code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that the drand beacons are now <strong>unchained</strong> might give the <em>false impression</em> that they are <em>less secure</em> than the previous <em><strong>chained</strong></em> ones, however this is not the case:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Predictability:</strong> An attacker controlling a threshold number of shares is able to predict any arbitrary round in the unchained setting, whereas they would need to compute all intermediary rounds to predict a given future round with the chained setting. <em>However</em>, controlling a threshold amount of shares at any point in time allows computation of the shared secret of the group, and nothing can prevent such an attacker having obtained the group secret from then computing all future chained rounds offline much faster than the existing network would have, leading to the same result as in the unchained case: complete predictability of all future rounds in case of a compromise of either scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Bias:</strong> All future beacons are entirely determined by two things: the initial Distributed Key Generation and their round number. This was already the case for the chained network and hasn’t changed with the unchained schemes. For a given distributed group public key, future rounds cannot be biased in any way after the initial Distributed Key Generation ceremony has been run.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also made sure our new Timelock Encryption service relying on our new <code>quicknet</code> network was <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/05/26/tlock-security-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">properly audited</a>. We’ve got you covered!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="extra-liveness"><strong>Extra Liveness!</strong><a href="#extra-liveness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to extra-liveness" title="Direct link to extra-liveness">​</a></h2>
<p>From a <strong>liveness</strong> point of view, the way the drand nodes operate hasn’t changed and we are very happy to announce the availability of a new official HTTP relay run by <a href="https://www.storswift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StorSwift</a>, a dear member of the League of Entropy. Their relay is reachable at <a href="https://api.drand.secureweb3.com:6875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.drand.secureweb3.com:6875</a> and as you can see by querying <a href="https://api.drand.secureweb3.com:6875/chains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.drand.secureweb3.com:6875/chains</a>, it provides access to both our mainnet <code>default</code> and mainnet <code>quicknet</code> beacons. It is also located in Asia.</p>
<p>As you can see, the League of Entropy’s and drand’s security, liveness, and availability are not impacted in any way by these changes - on the contrary.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="onward"><strong>Onward!</strong><a href="#onward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to onward" title="Direct link to onward">​</a></h2>
<p>That’s it, we’ve launched everything we need to allow you to start using Timelock Encryption or drand random beacons right now in your services! And actually, people do!</p>
<p>If you are already doing so, or plan on doing so, don’t hesitate to join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drand Slack</a>, since we love hearing about what people are doing with what we’ve built!</p>

<p>TOPLINE: After four years of stewarding the <a href="https://github.com/drand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drand</a> project on behalf of <a href="https://leagueofentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoE</a>, <a href="https://protocol.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Labs</a> has decided to spin off our drand team into its own private enterprise, now called <a href="https://randa.mu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randamu</a>.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Protocol Labs is undergoing a slow and steady process of decentralization, expected to culminate by the end of this year. At its conclusion, Protocol Labs will no longer be one company but rather a network of companies known as the Protocol Labs Network (PLN). Today the PLN is already approaching 100 independent companies - each unique, but bound together in common cause to drive breakthroughs in computing that push humanity forward. For more details please visit the <a href="https://protocol.ai/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Labs Blog</a>.</p>
<p>What do these changes mean for you, the League of Entropy and the drand codebase?</p>
<p>TLDR; not much change in the near term, but expect new opportunities to collaborate in the coming months.</p>
<p>Both Protocol Labs and Randamu remain steadfast in our commitments to public goods, the League of Entropy, open-source software, and the drand codebase. Protocol Labs plans to continue maintaining their nodes through Randamu. We are humbled and honored by the trust they have placed in us to improve and maintain drand, while continuing to shepherd LoE network operations - we don&#x27;t expect any of that to change, but to ensure we aren’t relying on any incorrect assumptions, we will put this to a vote in the loe-governance Slack channel.</p>
<p>Moving forward we are updating drand in v2.0 to enable asynchronous ceremonies - no more jumping on the phone at odd hours for periodic key re-sharing. This, plus other improvements should help drand&#x27;s operation to become more automated in the coming weeks, requiring less of your valuable time and attention.</p>
<p>The Randamu team is excited by the opportunities we have before us as an independent organization. We have a growing list of commercial offerings based on threshold cryptography in our development pipeline, several of which benefit from drand, and some of which you, as an LoE member, may wish to partner with us on. We&#x27;ll keep you posted here as these plans develop and mature.</p>
<p>Please accept our deepest thanks for your continued trust and partnership.</p>
<p>Warm regards, -- Yolan, Patrick, Laith &amp; Erick (The Randamu Team)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="news tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/news">News</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/update">update</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="league of entropy tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/League-of_entropy">League-of-Entropy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/fastnet-to-be-sunset">fastnet to be sunset, long live quicknet</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-02T00:00:00.000Z">July 2, 2023</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Last month, we have identified <a href="https://github.com/drand/kyber-bls12381/issues/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**a minor issue</a>** in our implementation of the BLS signature on G1 used in the newly launched <code>fastnet</code> network. This is an RFC compliance issue which led us to plan the launch of a new compliant <code>quicknet</code> network and to spin down <code>fastnet</code>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issue"><strong>The Issue</strong><a href="#the-issue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-issue" title="Direct link to the-issue">​</a></h2>
<p>While not a <em>security issue</em> for drand, the problem is affecting our “hash to curve” function, used to map round numbers to a point on the elliptic curve that get signed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**threshold BLS</a>** by the drand network. The issue relates to the upcoming Hash To Curve <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/auth48/rfc9380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RFC 9380</strong></a>, which mandates specific “Domain Separation Tags“ (DST) for certain curves. In the BLS curve case, where we have two different groups (G1 and G2) that we can map to, the RFC recommends using different DST for both groups (it’s the point of having a DST!). Sadly, our implementation of BLS signatures was initially written to perform signatures on G2 and not on G1… (Stay tuned for an upcoming blog post about the choice of the group for BLS signatures!) The usage of a global variable in our codebase for the DST meant that both our G1 and G2 implementations were sharing the same DST. Since we don’t have “official test vectors” for BLS signatures on G1 and G2, this went unnoticed until <a href="https://drandworkspace.slack.com/archives/C011JB8NU2E/p1683527867397549?thread_ts=1683197659.071499&amp;cid=C011JB8NU2E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**someone tried</a>** to verify our signatures done on G1 with a C++ implementation and reported the issue in our Slack.</p>
<p>We launched our <code>fastnet</code> Testnet in February to try and identify any potential issues, while also allowing people to start building their applications on top of our new design featuring <a href="https://www.notion.so/2-1-Concepts-Cryptography-6b6cea36929e4b1b8ed5b00ad8600081?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>unchained randomness</strong></a> and <a href="/blog/tags/Timelock Encryption is now supported on drand main 327425b1e16d4c22aa0d785dbf1c5fbb.md"><strong>timelock capabilities</strong></a>. Despite this, the issue went unnoticed in all signature verification implementations that we tried with our drand beacons (including our typescript <a href="https://github.com/drand/drand-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**drand-client</a>** codebase and two different third party Rust implementations of drand verification!). Amusingly, within weeks of this issue being identified, a second team, building their own timelock scheme on top of our new <code>fastnet</code> network, also identified the issue and reported it to us.</p>
<p>For us, the main takeaways here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to have as many test vectors as possible, generated using multiple, different implementations.</li>
<li>Generate more noise and community outreach around new network launches, including new testnets.</li>
<li>Expect early adopters to take at least 2-3 months to start testing their implementations building on top of your new features, and therefore plan your testnet and mainnet launches accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong><a href="#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to next-steps" title="Direct link to next-steps">​</a></h2>
<p>This issue means that <strong>all beacons</strong> emitted for the new <code>fastnet</code> network that we launched on March 1st are featuring signatures that are non-compliant with the hash to curve spec, and so is the case for beacons from our testnet.</p>
<p>While not a <em>security</em> issue for our usage, using the wrong domain separator tag to map points on G1 is non-compliant with the RFC and therefore not great for future compatibility and adoption of our new network. We have <a href="https://github.com/drand/drand/pull/1249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**already implemented a new, RFC-compliant scheme</a>** for drand, affectionately named <code>bls-unchained-g1-rfc9380</code>.</p>
<p>During investigations, we identified 4 main ways to solve this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do nothing and document the non-compliance</strong> of the signatures on the drand website, however this would have caused significant friction for future adoption, reducing the usability and the developer experience of drand.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new <code>quicknet</code> network and keep the existing <code>fastnet</code> network running</strong>, causing a 90% increase of the load of our existing nodes, forcing us to increase our tech debt and maintenance burden but not disrupting any existing users. (The verifiability of drand beacons allows our users to re-use them or redistribute them without us knowing about it. This further means that we do not have visibility into our user-base, and therefore, getting in contact with them to notify them of a “<code>fastnet</code> shutdown” is not an option).</li>
<li><strong>Create a new</strong> <code>fastnet</code> <strong>network (<code>quicknet</code>)</strong> using a <strong>compliant implementation</strong> of the signature function and <strong>shutdown</strong> the existing non-compliant one immediately. This would inevitably cause our current <code>fastnet</code> users to be completely stranded and having to switch quickly to our new <code>quicknet</code> network, causing serious disruption for our users.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new</strong> <code>quicknet</code> <strong>network</strong> using a <strong>compliant implementation</strong> of the signature function and <strong>sunset</strong> the existing one over multiple months before <strong>shutting it down entirely</strong>. This would allow our users to ensure 100% uptime of their services, while gradually migrating to the new network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above, <a href="https://www.notion.so/The-League-of-Entropy-1e76674b75e249699445799c5083fe78?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The League of Entropy</a> has voted and elected to choose the last option, using its governance process, and therefore will:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunset</strong> the current <code>fastnet</code> network, reduce the number of Mainnet nodes running it (from 21 with a <strong>threshold of 11</strong> to a committee of 14 with a <strong>threshold of 8</strong>), stop onboarding new nodes to it, and most importantly <strong>stop it entirely</strong> as soon as possible.</li>
<li>launch a new <code>quicknet</code> network with the same settings, e.g. 3 seconds frequency, 2 seconds catch-up period, <a href="/blog/tags/Multi-Frequency Support &amp; Timelock Encryption are  5c3651ad243541b698024016ecd24d26.md">**unchained randomness</a>** (thus compatible with timelock schemes), except it would be using our newly released <code>bls-unchained-g1-rfc9380</code> scheme which is RFC-compliant.</li>
<li>do the same on our Testnet <code>testnet-g</code> network, shutting it down before Mainnet, in order to allow us to effectively test the shutdown scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently planning to launch these new <code>quicknet</code> networks in July on both our Testnet and Mainnet.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consequences"><strong>Consequences</strong><a href="#consequences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to consequences" title="Direct link to consequences">​</a></h2>
<p>The biggest problem with shutting down our <code>fastnet</code> network, is that any usage of its public key to perform timelock encryption past the shutdown date will lead to ciphertexts that cannot be decrypted. This is because the required beacon’s signature won’t be emitted by the network. This means that whoever used our timelock system with our <code>fastnet</code> network (or our <code>testnet-g</code> one) and set a decryption date after their shutdown date won’t be able to decrypt their ciphertexts.</p>
<p>For “classical” public randomness usage, switching to a new network does not affect the quality or verifiability of the randomness.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recommendations"><strong>Recommendations</strong><a href="#recommendations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to recommendations" title="Direct link to recommendations">​</a></h2>
<p>For “public verifiable randomness usage”, we recommend always having a way to transition to a new “beacon chain” easily shall the need arise. This means being able to switch to a new public key and starting to monitor a new chainhash at a given time.</p>
<p>If you are working on a <strong>timelock</strong>-based system relying on our <code>fastnet</code> be aware that you’ll need to either launch a new version of your application in July, or plan a way to transition to our new network, and that any ciphertexts meant for December, or later, on <code>fastnet</code> are not going to be decryptable after that point. The League of Entropy members will be deleting their secret shares allowing them to perform the threshold operations required to produce valid signatures for the group. We recommend communicating to your users that they’ll need to re-issue any such ciphertexts using the new network if they want them to be decryptable after December 2023.</p>
<p>If you are using our <code>fastnet</code> for randomness, plan your transition to the new network by the end of Q3’2023.</p>
<p>Please, don’t hesitate to reach us (for example on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>our Slack</strong></a>) in case you have any concerns or if your current <code>fastnet</code> usage cannot accommodate a shutdown of the <code>fastnet</code> network by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more blog posts about the groups G1 and G2 and how to choose the right one when doing BLS signatures, as well as for the quicknet launch announcement after our new upcoming Distributed Key Generation ceremony. See you on quicknet in July!</p>

<p>The drand community and developer base is expanding rapidly. drand usage is gaining momentum with many applications using it to draw randomness for their systems. While our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**slack workspace</a>** is a great place to interact with other developers and the drand core maintainers, code walkthroughs are even better if one wants to gain a holistic view of the system, become familiar with nitty gritty details, and ask questions in real time.</p>
<p>With those benefits in mind, we have designed and will be running a series of virtual code walkthroughs on the drand codebase. The series consists of eight (8) sessions, taking place <strong>every other Tuesday at 1430 UTC, starting on the 20th of June</strong>. Each session is scheduled to last approximately 45mins with 30mins for Q&amp;A and pair programming assistance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Tuesday, <strong>20th June 2023</strong>, 1430 UTC</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> We will explain what the drand binary is, what it does and run through all of the CLI commands and related parameters to explain how to start a node as an operator and how to sync and follow other nodes. We will also run a Distributed Key Generation (DKG), perhaps the most central part of setting up a drand network. In this session we will not go through the DKG code, which is subject to another session. Finally we will do a walkthrough of the drand client libraries. There are currently two drand libraries (in Go and in JS), which we will use to consume drand randomness.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Tuesday, <strong>4th July 2023</strong>, 1430 UTC</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> This session will focus on the randomness beacons produced by the drand network. We will explain the different representations of a beacon, as well as the beacon model followed by the drand mainnet. We will also dive into the details of why drand randomness is “verifiable” and how to derive randomness from the signature. drand is based on “threshold cryptography”, which, in practice, means that every node is producing a “partial” of the final signature. In this session, we will explain how partials are aggregated to produce the final randomness beacon.</li>

<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Tuesday, <strong>1st August 2023</strong>, 1430 UTC</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Distributed Key Generation is the most central part of the drand network and threshold cryptography more in general. In this session, we will dive into the details of basic concepts, such as the Shamir secret sharing, Pedersen DKG, the “group file” and their implementation. We will also go through the lifecycle of a DKG event, relevant security considerations and the difference between “initial sharing” vs “resharing”.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Tuesday, <strong>15th August 2023</strong>, 1430 UTC</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> At a high level, drand comes as one coherent system. However, it is composed of several subcomponents that are distinct and play a particular role in the operation of the overall system. In this session, we’re going to put puzzle pieces from previous sessions together, define the taxonomy of the components, specify where does one stop and the other start and how they communicate and interoperate with one another.</li>

<p>We are happy to announce that our timed release encryption scheme &quot;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>tlock</strong></a>&quot; and its implementations, which we introduced in our <a href="/blog/tags/Timelock Encryption is now supported on drand main 327425b1e16d4c22aa0d785dbf1c5fbb.md"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a>, have recently undergone a comprehensive security assessment by <a href="/blog/The League of Entropy 1e76674b75e249699445799c5083fe78/League Partners 89fecb56737044e5bdfbbb3f6864a422/Kudelski Security d800657770494c6cb39cffb5480407a4.md">Kudelski Security</a>. This was a crucial step in ensuring the robustness and reliability of our encryption system in order to guarantee that timelocked content remains encrypted until the time has come for it to be decrypted and never before.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong><a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to overview" title="Direct link to overview">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="/blog/The League of Entropy 1e76674b75e249699445799c5083fe78/League Partners 89fecb56737044e5bdfbbb3f6864a422/Kudelski Security d800657770494c6cb39cffb5480407a4.md">Kudelski Security</a>, a renowned provider of cybersecurity solutions, was engaged to review the implementation of drand’s timelock encryption scheme and timelock responsible disclosure demo. The work covered:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tlock</code>, our <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Go implementation</a>** as both a library and a command line tool (<code>tle</code>) for timelock encryption.</li>
<li><code>tlock-js</code>, our interoperable <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock-js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**TypeScript implementation</a>** of timelock encryption.</li>
<li><code>timevault</code>, our web demo for timelock encryption, which is available at <a href="https://timevault.drand.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://timevault.drand.love/</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Their critical security dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit primarily focused on code security, protocol security, and ensuring our implementations matched the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tlock paper</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-audit-findings">📋 <strong>Audit Findings</strong><a href="#-audit-findings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -audit-findings" title="Direct link to -audit-findings">​</a></h2>
<p>During the audit, Kudelski Security identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 High severity issue</li>
<li>5 Medium severity issues</li>
<li>3 Low severity issues</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth highlighting that none of the identified issues would have put existing encrypted data at risk. We are pleased to report that all identified issues have been addressed and corrected. The <strong>detailed audit report is available on IPFS</strong> with CID <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWQvTdiD3fSwJgasPLppHZKP6SMvsuTUnb1vRP2xM7y4m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>QmWQvTdiD3fSwJgasPLppHZKP6SMvsuTUnb1vRP2xM7y4m</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-security-considerations">🛡️ <strong>Security Considerations</strong><a href="#️-security-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ️-security-considerations" title="Direct link to ️-security-considerations">​</a></h2>
<p>The security of our timelock encryption system relies on four main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The security of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boneh%E2%80%93Franklin_scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Identity Encryption Scheme</a>** from 2001 that we used, and our implementation of it.</li>
<li>The security of the underlying threshold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**BLS scheme</a>** from 2003 that we used, and our implementation of it.</li>
<li>The security of <code>age</code>&#x27;s underlying primitives, and that of the <code>age</code> implementation used to encrypt the actual data. (See <a href="https://age-encryption.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**https://age-encryption.org/</a>** for details about <code>age</code>.)</li>
<li>The security of the threshold network providing you with its BLS signatures at a given frequency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that neither the BLS, nor the IBE scheme are &quot;quantum resistant&quot;. However, a quantum computer that is able to break them seems unlikely to be built within the next 5-10 years, therefore we currently believe you can expect a &quot;long term security&quot; horizon of about five years by relying on our design for timed release encryption.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-conclusion">🏆 <strong>Conclusion</strong><a href="#-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -conclusion" title="Direct link to -conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>We are grateful to the Kudelski Security Research team for their thorough and professional audit. Their expertise has been critical in helping us improve the security of drand&#x27;s timelock encryption functionality. We also want to thank the Kudelski team for the smooth collaboration and availability throughout the assessment.</p>
<p>However, it&#x27;s important to note that no security assessment can guarantee 100% security. While we&#x27;ve taken extensive measures to ensure the security of our timelock encryption system, we encourage users to understand the security considerations and make informed decisions, especially when encrypting data for a long time period.</p>
<p>Our code being entirely open-source, further scrutiny and reviews are always welcome. Don&#x27;t hesitate to <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**join our Slack workspace</a>** to discuss our Timelock design, possible use-cases, or to show us what you&#x27;ve done with it!</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to enhance the security and reliability of our systems, and we remain committed to transparency and collaboration in all our endeavors.</p>

<p>The drand team has been busy during the past year working on delivering an exciting new feature: <strong>Timelock Encryption</strong>. Timelock encryption enables you to encrypt a message that cannot be decrypted by anyone until a specified time in the future.</p>
<p>You might have heard about it from us already, since we were proud to present not just one, but <em>three</em> new open-source projects in August 2022, bringing a new very exciting feature called “timelock encryption” to our drand testnet!</p>
<p>Well, wait no more: we have now finally reached “General Availability” and our <em>audited</em> Timelock Encryption scheme is <strong>now compatible with the drand mainnet</strong>, thanks to our newly launched <code>fastnet</code> network which we’ll discuss quickly in this post as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to the team&#x27;s work, you can now use these features in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://timevault.drand.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Our Timevault web-demo</strong></a> using <code>tlock-js</code> to perform timelock encryption easily in your browser, locally.</li>
<li><code>tlock</code>, a <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Go library doing Timelock encryption</strong></a> by relying on drand’s beacon signatures, along with <code>tle</code> - a CLI tool allowing you to use timelock encryption just like you would use <code>gpg</code> or <code>age</code>.</li>
<li><code>tlock-js</code>, a <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock-js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TS library doing the same</strong></a> for your browser apps.</li>
<li>Using the unchained drand beacons from our new <code>fastnet</code> network: <a href="https://api.drand.sh/dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493/public/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.drand.sh/dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493/public/latest</a></li>
</ul>
<aside><p>⚠️ NOTE: <code>fastnet</code> has been deprecated in favor of <code>quicknet</code> since the original publication of this blog post.</p></aside>
<p>These were already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1652&amp;v=IW7sdSd2wOQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>presented at DEF CON</strong></a> when we launched them on our testnet. Check the talk if you want more details about possible applications and the history behind Timelock Encryption.</p>
<p>More recently, we released a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>pre-print paper</strong></a> explaining the details of our timelock scheme and we have a talk scheduled at Real World Crypto tomorrow, on March 29th, 2023 where we’ll explain more in depth how <strong>we transformed the League of Entropy</strong> and drand into the first practical <strong>Timelock Encryption service</strong> globally available with a <strong>100% uptime history</strong> over the past 3 years!</p>
<p>But for today let’s first see what this “Timelock Encryption” we’re talking about is.</p>
<p>P.S.: If this has piqued your interest and you’d rather watch a video about how this works, you can also find more technical explanations about what is coming next in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgsv4LY0Sn0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Research Seminar</strong></a> that we gave in September!</p>

<p>In order to understand how the system works, we need to first recall a few things about how drand functions…</p>
<p>First things first, let’s recall that <code>drand</code>, which stands for “<strong>distributed randomness</strong>” (and thus pronounced “dee-rand”), is our very own <a href="https://github.com/drand/drand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>open-source software</strong></a> meant to create distributed randomness networks. These networks emit <strong>random “beacons” at a given frequency</strong> in a way that you never need to trust any single party in the network, and can <em><strong>verify</strong></em> that you actually have random values as long as you trust there is <strong>never a threshold number of malicious parties</strong> in the network, thus the security of the threshold BLS signature scheme holds.</p>
<p>To accomplish this drand relies on the threshold BLS signature scheme and its security proof that tells us BLS signatures are indistinguishable from random ones (in the group of all possible signatures). At each epoch, the members of a drand network work together to create an aggregated BLS signature on the message <strong>m = H(round)}</strong>. An important point here for what comes next is that the <strong>message is predictable</strong> according to the target round at a time T (in other words, there is a mapping between time and round numbers, since the network operates at a fixed frequency), when we’re using drand in the so-called unchained mode that <a href="/blog/tags/Multi-Frequency Support &amp; Timelock Encryption are  5c3651ad243541b698024016ecd24d26.md"><strong>we presented in a post last year</strong></a>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about drand and how it works under the hood in our documentation: <a href="https://www.notion.so/2-1-Concepts-Cryptography-6b6cea36929e4b1b8ed5b00ad8600081?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cryptography Page</strong></a></p>

<p>The League of Entropy is a consortium of organisations that decided, back in 2019, to start running a global drand network in order to provide free, unbiased, and verifiable public randomness for anyone to use. Since 2019, the League has been growing steadily, with new members joining it regularly and thus increasing the security and trust we can have in the League. You can read more about the League on Cloudflare’s website: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/leagueofentropy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://www.cloudflare.com/leagueofentropy/</strong></a></p>
<p>As of March 2023, the League is constituted of over 21 drand nodes operated by 18 organisations, with a threshold of over 50%, and you can follow our blog to see when new partners are joining the League: <a href="/blog/Blog 83785fc385334bd9b893ae3817f2944a.md">Blog</a></p>
<p>In case you were worried after reading our paper, know that whenever new members join the League, we conduct a so-called “resharing” of the League’s group secret key using verifiable secret sharing. This means that <strong>the public keys of the drand networks we run never change</strong> and it is not going to cause an incompatibility issue with our timelock scheme.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-timed-release-encryption-scheme"><strong>Our “timed release encryption” scheme</strong><a href="#our-timed-release-encryption-scheme" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to our-timed-release-encryption-scheme" title="Direct link to our-timed-release-encryption-scheme">​</a></h3>
<p>Our timelock scheme, also sometimes called a “timed release encryption” (TRE) scheme, is a direct application of the <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/bfibe.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Identity Based Encryption scheme</strong></a> (IBE) from Boneh et al. (section 4.2) to the threshold BLS signature setting of drand.</p>
<p>In IBE, participants are referred to via their <strong>identity</strong> which can be an email, a name, etc. and anyone can encrypt a message to any identity, even if the recipient is not “registered” with the system. This works because there is a Private Key Generator (PKG) service that distributes the required secret keys to participants depending on their identity.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the League of Entropy is basically acting as a <strong>“Distributed PKG” network</strong> because they’re using the BLS scheme to sign messages and, (as already denoted in the initial 2001 IBE paper), the decryption keys of their IBE scheme can be used as signatures over a given identity, which is exactly what the BLS scheme is accomplishing.</p>
<p>Moreover, it uses <strong>the round number as the identity</strong>, <strong>and the corresponding signature becomes the private key to decrypt.</strong> In short:</p>
<p>Public key = <strong>round number</strong></p>
<p>Private key = <strong>signature over the round number</strong></p>
<p>Given this, the flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can encrypt a message towards a specific round X in advance</li>
<li>When the time has come, the network will generate the BLS signature (i.e. the <em>private key)</em> and release it publicly</li>
<li>Anybody can retrieve the BLS signature of the beacon produced at round X and decrypt any message that was encrypted towards that round X.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more technical information about how this works, you can <strong>check our pre-print paper</strong> about our Timelock Encryption scheme on ePrint <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hybrid-encryption"><strong>Hybrid Encryption</strong><a href="#hybrid-encryption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to hybrid-encryption" title="Direct link to hybrid-encryption">​</a></h2>
<p>Because our timed release encryption scheme allows users to <strong>encrypt a fixed sized message</strong>, and also to achieve better performance in general, it relies on “<strong>Hybrid encryption</strong>” to encrypt arbitrary data more easily. Hybrid encryption means that we are using an asymmetric encryption scheme to <strong>encrypt a Data Encryption Key (DEK)</strong> used to subsequently encrypt the actual data we want to transmit with a symmetric encryption scheme. This is commonly known as “wrapping a key”, and it&#x27;s how modern public key encryption schemes function to encrypt more data than their “block size”. It has the benefit of being much faster than doing asymmetric encryption of each chunk of data. Typically, the DEK is an AES or ChaCha key, both being blazingly fast symmetric encryption schemes compared to the public key scheme used to encrypt the DEK.</p>
<p>Hybrid encryption also allows users to significantly reduce the size of a ciphertext meant for multiple recipients, since one only needs to wrap the DEK for different recipients while the bulk of the encrypted data remains the same for all recipients since it was encrypted with a single symmetric key.</p>
<p>In practice, we decided the easiest way to implement this was to rely on the existing <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><code>age</code></strong></a> library and tool to create new types of “recipients” and “identities” for it using our timelock scheme to wrap symmetric encryption keys. This is made easier with <code>age</code> through the notion of “stanzas”, data itself is encrypted using a <code>filekey</code> which is then encrypted (wrapped) using one or multiple stanzas following the battle-tested hybrid encryption technique.</p>
<p>We tried to stay pretty close to the age-plugin format in order to possibly adapt this new scheme into a plugin, perhaps sometime in the future. Here is our custom tlock stanza:</p>

<p>We have implemented the scheme in a <strong>Golang library</strong> <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>tlock</strong></a> and a <strong>Typescript library</strong> <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>tlock-js</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For convenience, we have implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a web demo</strong> at <a href="https://timevault.drand.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://timevault.drand.love/</strong></a> using our tlock-js library</li>
<li><strong>a CLI utility</strong> <code>tle</code> that you can find on the <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock#install-or-build-the-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>tlock repo</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>tlock</code> Go library is a pure Go library implemented on top of an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/drand/kyber/tree/master/encrypt/ibe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IBE in our Kyber library</strong></a> fork and instantiated using <a href="https://github.com/kilic/bls12-381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>kilic’s BLS12-381</strong></a> elliptic curve library. The <code>tle</code> CLI tool is built following the same kind of flags as used in <code>age</code> itself. Here’s a quick demo using it:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/181501/177999855-cc1cfef7-ee1c-4193-bea7-4ee2e689f2d1.svg" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/181501/177999855-cc1cfef7-ee1c-4193-bea7-4ee2e689f2d1.svg" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The <code>tlock-js</code> is a pure Typescript implementation of timed encryption using the drand network. Like the <code>tlock</code> Go library, it uses <a href="http://age-encryption.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Age encryption</strong></a> under the hood to perform symmetric encryption on a given payload using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>chacha20-poly1305</strong></a> and wraps the symmetric key using timelock encryption. This ciphertext is then (optionally) encoded using ascii armor making it easy to move around and display - similar to what PGP and other utilities do.</p>
<p>The library only has a handful of dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>some of the noble crypto libraries (the de facto standard for many algorithms in js/ts)</li>
<li>Stablelib’s chacha20-poly1305 implementation</li>
<li>a polyfill for node’s <code>Buffer</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s available on npm at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tlock-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://www.npmjs.com/package/tlock-js</strong></a> and github at <a href="https://github.com/drand/tlock-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://github.com/drand/tlock-js</strong></a> and is used by our <a href="https://timevault.drand.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Timevault web demo</strong></a>!</p>
<p>Finally, to ensure the best security guarantees possible to our users, we had both <code>tlock</code> and <code>tlock-js</code> go through a code assessment by a renowned cybersecurity company, which we’ll be releasing shortly as well.</p>
<h1><strong>Our new <code>fastnet</code> network</strong></h1>
<p>The best part about our timelock solution is that it is live on our mainnet! You can try it in your browser here: <a href="https://timevault.drand.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://timevault.drand.love/</strong></a></p>
<p>This is possible because the League of Entropy actually launched a new drand mainnet network, on March 1st, 2023: the <code>fastnet</code> 🏎️ network! It is readily available through our mainnet endpoints: <a href="https://api.drand.sh/dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493/info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://api.drand.sh/dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493/info</strong></a></p>

<p>It is running at a 3 second frequency, which is 10 times faster than our previous chained <code>default</code> mainnet network, and it uses G1 for signatures, which means its random beacons have signatures that are 50% smaller! It is also running in unchained mode, and thus enables timelock encryption on mainnet!</p>
<p>You can start building your very own sealed-bid auction system on top of it, <a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2023/02/22/releasing-a-timelocked-responsible-disclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>do a timelocked responsible disclosure</strong></a>, or use it as a <a href="https://gwern.net/self-decrypting#uses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>deadman’s switch by encrypting your bitcoin private key</strong></a> with it and giving the timelocked ciphertext to your heirs, while having the full security of running on the League of Entropy mainnet instead of on our testnet, as was the case until now.</p>
<p>Expect another blog post in the coming months with more details about the G1/G2 swap in <code>fastnet</code>, and what it means for BLS signatures, and for the applications using drand beacons. (Hints: smaller footprint, better performance and, where applicable, much cheaper gas costs!)</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that IPFSForce has joined the League of Entropy!</p>
<p>IPFSForce has focused on technology research and development in blockchain since 2017. With the vision of being Web 3.0’s infrastructure service provider, IPFSForce is working to make storage more efficient, cost-effective, open, and safer. With &quot;Co-built Value, Sharing Honour&quot; as a guiding principle, IPFSForce leverages technologies to empower global communities with high-quality services.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve asked IPFSForce some key questions that we&#x27;ve previously asked other LoE members - see <a href="/blog/tags/The Value of drand (Part 1 of 2) 0cc0bb5ecb6d471da62152370180701b.md"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="/blog/tags/The Value of drand (Part 2 of 2) 6d53b4cc6b5f4f31a8cab0b3fe2e94c3.md"><strong>here</strong></a> - on the value of drand. Check out what they said.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why is drand important as a protocol for the next generation of the Internet in your opinion?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The blockchain industry and the broader Web 3.0 ecosphere are in dire need of a decentralized, scalable, impartial, verifiable, and secure service that delivers randomness, which is exactly the mission of drand: to create and provide such a service. A randomness service is no doubt the most fundamental component to the decentralized world.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to join the League of Entropy? What value do you see in drand that is important for your mission? In other words, what convinced you to join?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to become a Web 3.0 infrastructure service provider, and drand is envisioned as an Internet infrastructure level service that offers randomness to applications. That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re comparable in certain ways. Furthermore, it has always been in our best interests to assist and participate in such research-based security tech communities and products focusing on advanced technologies.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>How do you use drand in your setup, infrastructure or application?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As an IPFS/Filecoin service provider, we are using drand to provide Filecoin chain services to our customers. drand acts as a randomness beacon in the Filecoin network and has provided us with crucial services in block generation, various stages of <a href="https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-algorithms.pos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Proof of Replication (PoRep) and Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)</strong></a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>We expect that the LoE network will be more accessible to Web 3.0 partners, thereby encouraging more developers to be involved and build infrastructure and dApps utilizing drand as a randomness service. It is only with more partners engaging that the LoE network will be able to grow and better serve the Web 3.0 globe.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The League of Entropy evaluates, votes on, and onboards new members quarterly. If you want to be a part of the first production-grade distributed randomness beacon and help provide publicly verifiable randomness as a service, contact us at <a href="mailto:leagueofentropy@googlegroups.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leagueofentropy@googlegroups.com</a>. We are looking for enthusiastic teams with experience running secure production services who are interested in operating drand nodes and relays. We also encourage you to check out the drand GitHub repository for details.</em></p>

<p>As 2022 wrapped up, the drand team took a moment to reflect on the incredible journey we’ve been on. The year was packed with milestones, innovations, and expansions that have set the stage for an exciting future. Here’s a look back at some of the standout moments from our year.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-new-features-that-shaped-our-journey">🆕 New Features That Shaped Our Journey<a href="#-new-features-that-shaped-our-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🆕 New Features That Shaped Our Journey" title="Direct link to 🆕 New Features That Shaped Our Journey">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the highlights of 2022 was the development of some game-changing features:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-unchained-randomness-and-higher-frequency-beacons-">⛓️ Unchained Randomness and Higher Frequency Beacons 🚨<a href="#️-unchained-randomness-and-higher-frequency-beacons-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ⛓️ Unchained Randomness and Higher Frequency Beacons 🚨" title="Direct link to ⛓️ Unchained Randomness and Higher Frequency Beacons 🚨">​</a></h3>
<p>Early in the year, we rolled out unchained randomness and higher frequency beacons on our testnet. These features have shown immense potential, and we’ve been thrilled with their performance. They promise to expand the horizons for drand and the applications using it. We’ve been testing them rigorously, and they’ve been operational for several months now.</p>
<p><em>Want to dive deeper? Check out <a href="/blog/tags/Multi-Frequency Support &amp; Timelock Encryption are  5c3651ad243541b698024016ecd24d26.md">Multi-Frequency Support &amp; Timelock Encryption are coming to drand!</a> for all the details.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-timelock-encryption">⏱️ Timelock Encryption<a href="#️-timelock-encryption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ⏱️ Timelock Encryption" title="Direct link to ⏱️ Timelock Encryption">​</a></h3>
<p>Building on the success of unchained randomness, we developed Timelock Encryption on drand. This feature has been a hit, garnering a lot of attention and excitement. While it’s still in the testnet phase, we’ve already launched a web app, <a href="https://timevault.drand.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timevault</a>, and we’re looking forward to deploying it on the mainnet soon. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

<p>Monitoring and maintaining a robust network is crucial. This year, we made significant strides in enhancing our visibility into the drand network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrated Metrics:</strong> We embedded metrics directly into our codebase, providing a clearer view of the network’s health.</li>
<li><strong>New Dashboard:</strong> We built a comprehensive dashboard that gives us a holistic view of nodes before, during, and after resharing ceremonies. This tool has been instrumental in enabling async ceremonies, making the process more flexible for node operators.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most exciting developments of 2022 was our collaboration with CryptoSat. In October, we deployed drand on one of their satellites, sending it into space! This space node interacted with ground station nodes, marking a significant milestone in our journey.</p>
<p>We’re not stopping there. Our goal is to have a permanent drand node operating from space, further enhancing the resilience of our network.</p>
