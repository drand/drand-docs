<p>TOPLINE: After four years of stewarding the <a href="https://github.com/drand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drand</a> project on behalf of <a href="https://leagueofentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoE</a>, <a href="https://protocol.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Labs</a> has decided to spin off our drand team into its own private enterprise, now called <a href="https://randa.mu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randamu</a>.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Protocol Labs is undergoing a slow and steady process of decentralization, expected to culminate by the end of this year. At its conclusion, Protocol Labs will no longer be one company but rather a network of companies known as the Protocol Labs Network (PLN). Today the PLN is already approaching 100 independent companies - each unique, but bound together in common cause to drive breakthroughs in computing that push humanity forward. For more details please visit the <a href="https://protocol.ai/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Labs Blog</a>.</p>
<p>What do these changes mean for you, the League of Entropy and the drand codebase?</p>
<p>TLDR; not much change in the near term, but expect new opportunities to collaborate in the coming months.</p>
<p>Both Protocol Labs and Randamu remain steadfast in our commitments to public goods, the League of Entropy, open-source software, and the drand codebase. Protocol Labs plans to continue maintaining their nodes through Randamu. We are humbled and honored by the trust they have placed in us to improve and maintain drand, while continuing to shepherd LoE network operations - we don&#x27;t expect any of that to change, but to ensure we arenât relying on any incorrect assumptions, we will put this to a vote in the loe-governance Slack channel.</p>
<p>Moving forward we are updating drand in v2.0 to enable asynchronous ceremonies - no more jumping on the phone at odd hours for periodic key re-sharing. This, plus other improvements should help drand&#x27;s operation to become more automated in the coming weeks, requiring less of your valuable time and attention.</p>
<p>The Randamu team is excited by the opportunities we have before us as an independent organization. We have a growing list of commercial offerings based on threshold cryptography in our development pipeline, several of which benefit from drand, and some of which you, as an LoE member, may wish to partner with us on. We&#x27;ll keep you posted here as these plans develop and mature.</p>
<p>Please accept our deepest thanks for your continued trust and partnership.</p>
<p>Warm regards, -- Yolan, Patrick, Laith &amp; Erick (The Randamu Team)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="news tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/news">News</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/update">update</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="league of entropy tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/League-of_entropy">League-of-Entropy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/auttomata-network-joins-the-league-of-entropy">Automata Network Joins the League of Entropy!</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z">March 14, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>We are proud to announce that <a href="https://www.ata.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automata Network</a>, a web3 middleware protocol focused on protecting fairness &amp; privacy, is joining forces with the League of Entropy (LoE)! Automata is becoming the 17th member to join the LoE and the first partner joining from Singapore - a significant milestone for the LoE.</p>
<p>Weâve asked Automata some key questions that weâve regularly ask of new LoE members - see <a href="/blog/tags/The Value of drand (Part 1 of 2) 0cc0bb5ecb6d471da62152370180701b.md"><strong>here</strong></a>, <a href="/blog/tags/The Value of drand (Part 2 of 2) 6d53b4cc6b5f4f31a8cab0b3fe2e94c3.md"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="/blog/tags/StorSwift joins the League of Entropy! 4cfa4cda241e4769a98f410428e93ebf.md"><strong>here</strong></a> - on the value of drand. Here are the team&#x27;s answers.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why is drand important as a protocol for the next generation of the Internet in your opinion?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Randomness plays a critical role in modern infrastructure, but by far the most important and widely used aspect of it is within the field of cryptography. What really impressed us about drand was how the system approaches and realizes randomness - instead of having a single entity that controls the infrastructure where it runs, beacon providers work together and run their own nodes to ensure that no single party can either bias or predict the final output.</li>
<li>A diverse set of stakeholders is important in so many ways; in ensuring the integrity of the randomness being generated; in improving the transparency of the source of randomness; in making it such that no individual party is the single point of failure, be it benign or malicious. While Web3 on its own can sometimes be too vague to be a coherent goal, drand is an excellent example of what it takes to get the job done in a distributed fashion.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to join the League of Entropy? What value do you see in drand that is important for your mission? What convinced you to join?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fairness and privacy are important to us at Automata. The rise of Web3 - which has shown itself to be as much an ideological movement as much as it has been an economic one - has given us reason to believe that its subsequent development will be governed by a set of rules quite unlike its predecessors. A decentralized source of randomness is fundamental to a decentralized Web3.</li>
<li>In particular, there are a few characterizations that are helpful to keep in mind when it comes to considering what constitutes high-quality randomness: Anyone (such as users!) should be able to verify that a number is legitimately random. Randomness needs to be unbiased. No participant should be able to influence the output in any measure or way. Randomness needs to be unpredictable. No participant should be able to predict the output (or its properties) before it has been generated</li>
<li>drandâs passion about verifiable, unpredictable and bias-resistant randomness really spoke to us, and joining the League was an easy decision.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Please explain briefly how you use drand in your setup.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using random numbers generated by drandâs distributed randomness beacon helps to ensure the âfreshnessâ of the information at the point of computation, a global timestamp if you will. By integrating the latest number by drand - 256 bits of entropy generated every 30 seconds (also available every 3s in the latest deployment) - and ensuring that the random number is only valid during the interval it is generated, attackers are restricted in their ability to perform brute-force attacks, like reversing a one-way function.</li>
<li>Pre-computation is not possible if the number is not yet known and the interval limits the time attackers have to guess for any given valid number.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Where would you like to see drand in 2 years from now? What should we have achieved?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weâve been keeping a keen eye on drandâs roadmap and there have been some pretty exciting developments, including the Time-lock-encryption and Unchained Randomness, which now allows each randomness beacon to be independent of the previous one.</li>
<li>We would love to see drand grow to be the definitive source of randomness for Web3 and for the project to extend its capabilities in more impactful ways, some of which are: a) On-demand randomness for specific requests, such as the generation of random nonces to cater to users who need tailored randomness, b) Verifiable, confidential randomness to enable a wider range of use-cases such as gaming.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><strong>Why is drand important as a protocol for the next generation of the Internet in your opinion?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The blockchain industry and the broader Web 3.0 ecosphere are in dire need of a decentralized, scalable, impartial, verifiable, and secure service that delivers randomness, which is exactly the mission of drand: to create and provide such a service. A randomness service is no doubt the most fundamental component to the decentralized world.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to join the League of Entropy? What value do you see in drand that is important for your mission? In other words, what convinced you to join?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to become a Web 3.0 infrastructure service provider, and drand is envisioned as an Internet infrastructure level service that offers randomness to applications. That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re comparable in certain ways. Furthermore, it has always been in our best interests to assist and participate in such research-based security tech communities and products focusing on advanced technologies.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>How do you use drand in your setup, infrastructure or application?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As an IPFS/Filecoin service provider, we are using drand to provide Filecoin chain services to our customers. drand acts as a randomness beacon in the Filecoin network and has provided us with crucial services in block generation, various stages of <a href="https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-algorithms.pos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Proof of Replication (PoRep) and Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Where would you like to see drand in 2 years from now?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We expect that the LoE network will be more accessible to Web 3.0 partners, thereby encouraging more developers to be involved and build infrastructure and dApps utilizing drand as a randomness service. It is only with more partners engaging that the LoE network will be able to grow and better serve the Web 3.0 globe.</li>

Drand provides an elegant solution to this problem as a distributed, verifiable randomness beacon, allowing applications to only trust an uncorrupted threshold of parties in the system rather than a single entity. Trusted public randomness has many applications in the modern Internet; for example, it can help to provide auditability of lotteries or transparency in leader election processes.</p>

Originally, it was a development by Nicolas Gailly, at that time a PhD student at the DEDIS lab at EPFL, with contributions from Philipp Jovanovic and under the supervision of Bryan Ford.</p>
<p>Many protocols need a reliable, unbiased, and publicly-verifiable source of randomness. The DEDIS lab started work on decentralized randomness at Yale. Prof. Ford continued this work when he moved the lab to EPFL in 2015. As part of this mission, the DEDIS lab @ EPFL developed the crypto library Kyber, which provides all the major components to implement an efficient, distributed randomness generation protocol. The DEDIS lab is proud of contributing not just to the foundations, but also to the infrastructure providing public randomness.</p>

Over time, development on the NIST Randomness Beacon slowed down and NIST experienced intermittent reliability issues. We began searching for a replacement and decided drand was by far the best option.</p>

We are thrilled to announce that drand is now in production, offering publicly verifiable randomness as a foundational internet service.</p>
<p>In this post, we&#x27;ll introduce drand, highlight recent protocol upgrades, share details about the expansion of the League of Entropy&#x27;s largest deployment, and provide a glimpse into the future of drand and the League of Entropy.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-to-drand-heres-a-primer">New to drand? Here&#x27;s a Primer<a href="#new-to-drand-heres-a-primer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New to drand? Here&#x27;s a Primer" title="Direct link to New to drand? Here&#x27;s a Primer">â</a></h2>
<p>Randomness is crucial for many business-critical operations and protocols we use daily, such as secure communications cryptography and public lotteries. Despite its importance, there hasn&#x27;t been a source of public randomness capable of delivering truly unbiased randomness at scaleâuntil now. Drand was created to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Drand provides a universally accessible source of publicly verifiable, unbiasable, and unpredictable randomness. After an initial multi-party computation to establish a distributed key, drand nodes operated by independent parties periodically broadcast information. This data is aggregated into a final random beacon, whose validity users can easily verify.</p>
<p>Drand originated as a research project in the <a href="https://dedis.epfl.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEDIS lab at EPFL</a> and launched its first network experiment in 2019. After nearly a year of research, drand transitioned into a production-level public service. Recently, we introduced several changes and improvements and deployed drand&#x27;s largest network, the <a href="https://leagueofentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">League of Entropy</a>.</p>
<p>We believe drand can become a foundational internet service for randomness, accessible to everyone online, much like DNS or NTP.</p>
