# 2.0 Intro to drand

This section introduces the key concepts behind drand. For information about consuming randomness from a drand network, see the [**Developer's Guide**](../dev-guide/3-0-dev-guide). For help running a drand network, see the entries under the “For Operators” section. To run node(s) or relay(s) for the [League of Entropy](https://leagueofentropy.org), please [apply to the League](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGwiSz2_gq6NHo3MGyJyH4_GKv_TcY1YmbwkctKlCh5aVToA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to be considered for membership.

- Read the [**What is "drand"?**](../about/1-0-about) section to learn more about drand’s main goals.  It gives an overview of the challenges drand aims to address.
- [**Cryptography**](2-1-concepts-cryptography) provides an overview of the cryptographic building blocks that drand uses to generate publicly-verifiable, unbiased, and unpredictable randomness in a distributed manner.
- [**Security Model**](2-2-concepts-security-model) describes the security considerations taken into account when designing and building drand.
- [**Specification**](2-3-concepts-specification) is a formal description of the drand protocols.
- [**Timelock Encryption**](2-4-concepts-timelock-encryption) gives all the information on our Timelock Encryption scheme, and links on where to find the tools to use it.
