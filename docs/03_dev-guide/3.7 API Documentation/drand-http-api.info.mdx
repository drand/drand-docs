Drand provides a JSON HTTP interface that clients can use to fetch randomness from each drand network running on nodes. If you're using drand in an application, it may be easier and more secure to use one of the client libraries, which will also perform verification of randomness rounds and add additional features like failover, racing, aggregation, and caching.

All that's required is the address of the HTTP interface and way to fetch from HTTP, e.g. curl.
