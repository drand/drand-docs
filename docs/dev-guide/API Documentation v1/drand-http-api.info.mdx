drand provides a JSON HTTP interface that clients can use to fetch randomness from each drand network running on nodes.
If you're using drand in an application, it may be easier and more secure to use one of the client libraries, 
which will also perform verification of randomness rounds and add additional features like failover, racing, aggregation, 
and caching.

All that's required is the address of the HTTP interface and way to fetch from HTTP, e.g. curl.

## Public endpoints

The version 1 of the public [League of Entropy](https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/) HTTP APIs are available at:
- Protocol Labs
  - https://api.drand.sh/
  - https://api2.drand.sh/
  - https://api3.drand.sh/
- Cloudflare
  - https://drand.cloudflare.com/
- Storswift
  - https://api.drand.secureweb3.com:6875/

The League of Entropy currently runs three networks in mainnet: `default`, `fastnet` and `evmnet`. 
They are chained and unchained networks respectively, the details of which can be found in the [cryptography 
specification](/docs/cryptography/#randomness).

The chain hash for the League of Entropy `default` chain running at a 30s frequency in chained mode on Mainnet is:
`8990e7a9aaed2ffed73dbd7092123d6f289930540d7651336225dc172e51b2ce`

It also available at the default context, i.e. omitting the `/{chain-hash}` in the API specification below.

The chain hash for the League of Entropy `quicknet` network running at a 3s frequency in unchained mode on Mainnet is:
`52db9ba70e0cc0f6eaf7803dd07447a1f5477735fd3f661792ba94600c84e971`

The chain hash for the League of Entropy `evmnet` network running at a 3s frequency in unchained mode with the BN254 curve on Mainnet is:
`04f1e9062b8a81f848fded9c12306733282b2727ecced50032187751166ec8c3`

Note that [the fastnet network has been deprecated..](https://drand.love/blog/2023/07/03/fastnet-sunset-quicknet-new/)

## Testnet endpoints

Furthermore, we have "testnet endpoints" which are a completely separate environment for testing our latest changes, 
potentially helping you detect breaking changes or issues with our latest release before they hit mainnet. 
We recommend running your CI/CD against our testnet endpoints as well as our mainnet ones, in order to detect issues early.

We currently have 3 testnet HTTP(S) endpoints being run by:

- Protocol Labs
  - https://pl-us.testnet.drand.sh
  - https://pl-eu.testnet.drand.sh
- Cloudflare
  - https://testnet-api.drand.cloudflare.com

As you can see, they are currently running various chains as explained below. 
We are committed to maintaining the default, G2 based, chained testnet chain 
(`84b2234fb34e835dccd048255d7ad3194b81af7d978c3bf157e3469592ae4e02`) as well as 
the faster, G1 based, unchained quicknet-t testnet chain 
(`cc9c398442737cbd141526600919edd69f1d6f9b4adb67e4d912fbc64341a9a5`) 
as long as we run the equivalent mainnet networks.

Other testnet chains, such as our first "unchained" testnet 
(`7672797f548f3f4748ac4bf3352fc6c6b6468c9ad40ad456a397545c6e2df5bf`) or our first G1 based non-RFC compliant chain
(f3827d772c155f95a9fda8901ddd59591a082df5ac6efe3a479ddb1f5eeb202c) may be deprecated in the future.
